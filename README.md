This was a web app that utilized the Streamlit Python library to show home prices per county and state according to Zillow's data within the month of October 2023. This was joined on another dataset that contained population data from the US Census 2022. 

The population data was found here: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2020s-counties-total.html

The Housing data was found here: https://www.zillow.com/research/data/

Some of my work on Kaggle in cleaning the data to be used in my web app can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/mattkerekes/zillow
